# GoalLine
My interpretation of a Football Manager style game in C# and WPF

## Introduction
This started out as an experiment in C# and WPF to see if such a game was possible. After originally developing the beginning of the game engine with a console window front-end, I looked into creating a GUI for it, initially using Unity, but settling on WPF. 

The game is functional to a point, although not with many features, and does run matches.

This project is likely to be left alone for the foreseeable future as I've got involved in other things since.
